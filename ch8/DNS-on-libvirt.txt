Get the IP addresses that were assigned to our RPis by DHCP.


RPi> ifconfig  # to get the IP address for each RPi

Suppose they are: 192.168.122.250 and 192.168.122.249  for two seperate RPis.

Then run

Ubuntu> virsh net-edit default

and added the following 

<dns>
<host ip='192.168.122.250'>
  <hostname>foobar.com</hostname>
</host>
<host ip='192.168.122.249'>
  <hostname>me.com</hostname>
</host>
</dns>


After saving these changes

Next destroy and restart the network

Ubuntu> virsh net-destroy default
Ubuntu> virsh net-start default
